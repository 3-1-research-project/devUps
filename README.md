# MiniTwit

MiniTwit is a dashboard/blogging platoform where users can make posts. Originally made in Python, it is currently in 
the process of being reworked to a C#/React web-application. This project is part of the course DevOps at IT-Univeristy of Copenhagen, 2023. 





## Installation on Windows/Linux/macOS

Assuming you have Git Bash and Docker. Run the follwing in Git Bash or other preferred shell. 

```Git Bash
git clone https://github.com/TikoyX/devUps.git
```
From the directory, then run the follwing command with Docker running. 

```Git Bash
docker-compose up
```
A port for frontend and backend should appear. Try open port 3000 on local to see
the application.  

(Should this give problems with prior docker-files try to run "docker-compose build --no-cache")


## Usage

To have an active development environment, we suggest running the frontend directoiry with "npm start" and downloading 
the proper extensions for any development. 

There is a possibilty with CORS-issues for some users. We recommend adding a 'Cors Changer'-extension to the browser in this case.
